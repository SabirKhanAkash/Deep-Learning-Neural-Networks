# #### Notes
# - If you print the shapes of x_exp, x_sum and s above and rerun the assessment cell, you will see that x_sum is of shape (2,1) while x_exp and s are of shape (2,5). **x_exp/x_sum** works due to python broadcasting.
# 
# Congratulations! You now have a pretty good understanding of python numpy and have implemented a few useful functions that you will be using in deep learning.

# <font color='blue'>
# <b>What you need to remember:</b>
#     
# - np.exp(x) works for any np.array x and applies the exponential function to every coordinate
# - the sigmoid function and its gradient
# - image2vector is commonly used in deep learning
# - np.reshape is widely used. In the future, you'll see that keeping your matrix/vector dimensions straight will go toward eliminating a lot of bugs. 
# - numpy has efficient built-in functions
# - broadcasting is extremely useful

# ## 2 - Vectorization
# 
# 
# In deep learning, you deal with very large datasets. Hence, a non-computationally-optimal function can become a huge bottleneck in your algorithm and can result in a model that takes ages to run. To make sure that your code is  computationally efficient, you will use vectorization. For example, try to tell the difference between the following implementations of the dot/outer/elementwise product.

# In[24]:


import time

x1 = [9, 2, 5, 0, 0, 7, 5, 0, 0, 0, 9, 2, 5, 0, 0]
x2 = [9, 2, 2, 9, 0, 9, 2, 5, 0, 0, 9, 2, 5, 0, 0]

### CLASSIC DOT PRODUCT OF VECTORS IMPLEMENTATION ###
tic = time.process_time()
dot = 0

for i in range(len(x1)):
    dot += x1[i] * x2[i]
toc = time.process_time()
print ("dot = " + str(dot) + "\n ----- Computation time = " + str(1000 * (toc - tic)) + "ms")

### CLASSIC OUTER PRODUCT IMPLEMENTATION ###
tic = time.process_time()
outer = np.zeros((len(x1), len(x2))) # we create a len(x1)*len(x2) matrix with only zeros

for i in range(len(x1)):
    for j in range(len(x2)):
        outer[i,j] = x1[i] * x2[j]
toc = time.process_time()
print ("outer = " + str(outer) + "\n ----- Computation time = " + str(1000 * (toc - tic)) + "ms")

### CLASSIC ELEMENTWISE IMPLEMENTATION ###
tic = time.process_time()
mul = np.zeros(len(x1))

for i in range(len(x1)):
    mul[i] = x1[i] * x2[i]
toc = time.process_time()
print ("elementwise multiplication = " + str(mul) + "\n ----- Computation time = " + str(1000 * (toc - tic)) + "ms")

### CLASSIC GENERAL DOT PRODUCT IMPLEMENTATION ###
W = np.random.rand(3,len(x1)) # Random 3*len(x1) numpy array
tic = time.process_time()
gdot = np.zeros(W.shape[0])

for i in range(W.shape[0]):
    for j in range(len(x1)):
        gdot[i] += W[i,j] * x1[j]
toc = time.process_time()
print ("gdot = " + str(gdot) + "\n ----- Computation time = " + str(1000 * (toc - tic)) + "ms")


# In[25]:


x1 = [9, 2, 5, 0, 0, 7, 5, 0, 0, 0, 9, 2, 5, 0, 0]
x2 = [9, 2, 2, 9, 0, 9, 2, 5, 0, 0, 9, 2, 5, 0, 0]

### VECTORIZED DOT PRODUCT OF VECTORS ###
tic = time.process_time()
dot = np.dot(x1,x2)
toc = time.process_time()
print ("dot = " + str(dot) + "\n ----- Computation time = " + str(1000 * (toc - tic)) + "ms")

### VECTORIZED OUTER PRODUCT ###
tic = time.process_time()
outer = np.outer(x1,x2)
toc = time.process_time()
print ("outer = " + str(outer) + "\n ----- Computation time = " + str(1000 * (toc - tic)) + "ms")

### VECTORIZED ELEMENTWISE MULTIPLICATION ###
tic = time.process_time()
mul = np.multiply(x1,x2)
toc = time.process_time()
print ("elementwise multiplication = " + str(mul) + "\n ----- Computation time = " + str(1000*(toc - tic)) + "ms")

### VECTORIZED GENERAL DOT PRODUCT ###
tic = time.process_time()
dot = np.dot(W,x1)
toc = time.process_time()
print ("gdot = " + str(dot) + "\n ----- Computation time = " + str(1000 * (toc - tic)) + "ms")


# As you may have noticed, the vectorized implementation is much cleaner and more efficient. For bigger vectors/matrices, the differences in running time become even bigger. 
# 
# **Note** that `np.dot()` performs a matrix-matrix or matrix-vector multiplication. This is different from `np.multiply()` and the `*` operator (which is equivalent to  `.*` in Matlab/Octave), which performs an element-wise multiplication.

# ### 2.1 Implement the L1 and L2 loss functions
# 
# <a name='ex-8'></a>
# ### Exercise 8 - L1 
# Implement the numpy vectorized version of the L1 loss. You may find the function abs(x) (absolute value of x) useful.
# 
# **Reminder**:
# - The loss is used to evaluate the performance of your model. The bigger your loss is, the more different your predictions ($ \hat{y} $) are from the true values ($y$). In deep learning, you use optimization algorithms like Gradient Descent to train your model and to minimize the cost.
# - L1 loss is defined as:
# $$\begin{align*} & L_1(\hat{y}, y) = \sum_{i=0}^{m-1}|y^{(i)} - \hat{y}^{(i)}| \end{align*}\tag{6}$$

# <a name='ex-9'></a>
# ### Exercise 9 - L2
# Implement the numpy vectorized version of the L2 loss. There are several way of implementing the L2 loss but you may find the function np.dot() useful. As a reminder, if $x = [x_1, x_2, ..., x_n]$, then `np.dot(x,x)` = $\sum_{j=0}^n x_j^{2}$. 
# 
# - L2 loss is defined as $$\begin{align*} & L_2(\hat{y},y) = \sum_{i=0}^{m-1}(y^{(i)} - \hat{y}^{(i)})^2 \end{align*}\tag{7}$$
