# ### 1.4 - Normalizing rows
# 
# Another common technique we use in Machine Learning and Deep Learning is to normalize our data. It often leads to a better performance because gradient descent converges faster after normalization. Here, by normalization we mean changing x to $ \frac{x}{\| x\|} $ (dividing each row vector of x by its norm).
# 
# For example, if 
# $$x = \begin{bmatrix}
#         0 & 3 & 4 \\
#         2 & 6 & 4 \\
# \end{bmatrix}\tag{3}$$ 
# then 
# $$\| x\| = \text{np.linalg.norm(x, axis=1, keepdims=True)} = \begin{bmatrix}
#     5 \\
#     \sqrt{56} \\
# \end{bmatrix}\tag{4} $$
# and
# $$ x\_normalized = \frac{x}{\| x\|} = \begin{bmatrix}
#     0 & \frac{3}{5} & \frac{4}{5} \\
#     \frac{2}{\sqrt{56}} & \frac{6}{\sqrt{56}} & \frac{4}{\sqrt{56}} \\
# \end{bmatrix}\tag{5}$$ 
# 
# Note that you can divide matrices of different sizes and it works fine: this is called broadcasting and you're going to learn about it in part 5.
# 
# With `keepdims=True` the result will broadcast correctly against the original x.
# 
# `axis=1` means you are going to get the norm in a row-wise manner. If you need the norm in a column-wise way, you would need to set `axis=0`. 
# 
# numpy.linalg.norm has another parameter `ord` where we specify the type of normalization to be done (in the exercise below you'll do 2-norm). To get familiar with the types of normalization you can visit [numpy.linalg.norm](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.norm.html)
# 
# <a name='ex-6'></a>
# ### Exercise 6 - normalize_rows
# Implement normalizeRows() to normalize the rows of a matrix. After applying this function to an input matrix x, each row of x should be a vector of unit length (meaning length 1).
# 
# **Note**: Don't try to use `x /= x_norm`. For the matrix division numpy must broadcast the x_norm, which is not supported by the operant `/=`

normalizeRows_test(normalize_rows)


# **Note**:
# In normalize_rows(), you can try to print the shapes of x_norm and x, and then rerun the assessment. You'll find out that they have different shapes. This is normal given that x_norm takes the norm of each row of x. So x_norm has the same number of rows but only 1 column. So how did it work when you divided x by x_norm? This is called broadcasting and we'll talk about it now!

# ### Exercise 7 - softmax
# Implement a softmax function using numpy. You can think of softmax as a normalizing function used when your algorithm needs to classify two or more classes. You will learn more about softmax in the second course of this specialization.
# 
# **Instructions**:
# - $\text{for } x \in \mathbb{R}^{1\times n} \text{,     }$
# 
# \begin{align*}
#  softmax(x) &= softmax\left(\begin{bmatrix}
#     x_1  &&
#     x_2 &&
#     ...  &&
#     x_n  
# \end{bmatrix}\right) \\&= \begin{bmatrix}
#     \frac{e^{x_1}}{\sum_{j}e^{x_j}}  &&
#     \frac{e^{x_2}}{\sum_{j}e^{x_j}}  &&
#     ...  &&
#     \frac{e^{x_n}}{\sum_{j}e^{x_j}} 
# \end{bmatrix} 
# \end{align*}
# 
# - $\text{for a matrix } x \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n} \text{,  $x_{ij}$ maps to the element in the $i^{th}$ row and $j^{th}$ column of $x$, thus we have: }$  
# 
# \begin{align*}
# softmax(x) &= softmax\begin{bmatrix}
#             x_{11} & x_{12} & x_{13} & \dots  & x_{1n} \\
#             x_{21} & x_{22} & x_{23} & \dots  & x_{2n} \\
#             \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
#             x_{m1} & x_{m2} & x_{m3} & \dots  & x_{mn}
#             \end{bmatrix} \\ \\&= 
#  \begin{bmatrix}
#     \frac{e^{x_{11}}}{\sum_{j}e^{x_{1j}}} & \frac{e^{x_{12}}}{\sum_{j}e^{x_{1j}}} & \frac{e^{x_{13}}}{\sum_{j}e^{x_{1j}}} & \dots  & \frac{e^{x_{1n}}}{\sum_{j}e^{x_{1j}}} \\
#     \frac{e^{x_{21}}}{\sum_{j}e^{x_{2j}}} & \frac{e^{x_{22}}}{\sum_{j}e^{x_{2j}}} & \frac{e^{x_{23}}}{\sum_{j}e^{x_{2j}}} & \dots  & \frac{e^{x_{2n}}}{\sum_{j}e^{x_{2j}}} \\
#     \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
#     \frac{e^{x_{m1}}}{\sum_{j}e^{x_{mj}}} & \frac{e^{x_{m2}}}{\sum_{j}e^{x_{mj}}} & \frac{e^{x_{m3}}}{\sum_{j}e^{x_{mj}}} & \dots  & \frac{e^{x_{mn}}}{\sum_{j}e^{x_{mj}}}
# \end{bmatrix} \\ \\ &= \begin{pmatrix}
#     softmax\text{(first row of x)}  \\
#     softmax\text{(second row of x)} \\
#     \vdots  \\
#     softmax\text{(last row of x)} \\
# \end{pmatrix} 
# \end{align*}

# **Notes:**
# Note that later in the course, you'll see "m" used to represent the "number of training examples", and each training example is in its own column of the matrix. Also, each feature will be in its own row (each row has data for the same feature).  
# Softmax should be performed for all features of each training example, so softmax would be performed on the columns (once we switch to that representation later in this course).
# 
# However, in this coding practice, we're just focusing on getting familiar with Python, so we're using the common math notation $m \times n$  
# where $m$ is the number of rows and $n$ is the number of columns.

# Congratulations! You now have a pretty good understanding of python numpy and have implemented a few useful functions that you will be using in deep learning.

# <font color='blue'>
# <b>What you need to remember:</b>
#     
# - np.exp(x) works for any np.array x and applies the exponential function to every coordinate
# - the sigmoid function and its gradient
# - image2vector is commonly used in deep learning
# - np.reshape is widely used. In the future, you'll see that keeping your matrix/vector dimensions straight will go toward eliminating a lot of bugs. 
# - numpy has efficient built-in functions
# - broadcasting is extremely useful

# ## 2 - Vectorization
# 
# 
# In deep learning, you deal with very large datasets. Hence, a non-computationally-optimal function can become a huge bottleneck in your algorithm and can result in a model that takes ages to run. To make sure that your code is  computationally efficient, you will use vectorization. For example, try to tell the difference between the following implementations of the dot/outer/elementwise product.

# In[24]:


import time

x1 = [9, 2, 5, 0, 0, 7, 5, 0, 0, 0, 9, 2, 5, 0, 0]
x2 = [9, 2, 2, 9, 0, 9, 2, 5, 0, 0, 9, 2, 5, 0, 0]

### CLASSIC DOT PRODUCT OF VECTORS IMPLEMENTATION ###
tic = time.process_time()
dot = 0

for i in range(len(x1)):
    dot += x1[i] * x2[i]
toc = time.process_time()
print ("dot = " + str(dot) + "\n ----- Computation time = " + str(1000 * (toc - tic)) + "ms")

### CLASSIC OUTER PRODUCT IMPLEMENTATION ###
tic = time.process_time()
outer = np.zeros((len(x1), len(x2))) # we create a len(x1)*len(x2) matrix with only zeros

for i in range(len(x1)):
    for j in range(len(x2)):
        outer[i,j] = x1[i] * x2[j]
toc = time.process_time()
print ("outer = " + str(outer) + "\n ----- Computation time = " + str(1000 * (toc - tic)) + "ms")

### CLASSIC ELEMENTWISE IMPLEMENTATION ###
tic = time.process_time()
mul = np.zeros(len(x1))

for i in range(len(x1)):
    mul[i] = x1[i] * x2[i]
toc = time.process_time()
print ("elementwise multiplication = " + str(mul) + "\n ----- Computation time = " + str(1000 * (toc - tic)) + "ms")

### CLASSIC GENERAL DOT PRODUCT IMPLEMENTATION ###
W = np.random.rand(3,len(x1)) # Random 3*len(x1) numpy array
tic = time.process_time()
gdot = np.zeros(W.shape[0])

for i in range(W.shape[0]):
    for j in range(len(x1)):
        gdot[i] += W[i,j] * x1[j]
toc = time.process_time()

x2 = [9, 2, 2, 9, 0, 9, 2, 5, 0, 0, 9, 2, 5, 0, 0]

### VECTORIZED DOT PRODUCT OF VECTORS ###
tic = time.process_time()
dot = np.dot(x1,x2)
toc = time.process_time()
print ("dot = " + str(dot) + "\n ----- Computation time = " + str(1000 * (toc - tic)) + "ms")

### VECTORIZED OUTER PRODUCT ###
tic = time.process_time()
outer = np.outer(x1,x2)
toc = time.process_time()
print ("outer = " + str(outer) + "\n ----- Computation time = " + str(1000 * (toc - tic)) + "ms")

### VECTORIZED ELEMENTWISE MULTIPLICATION ###
tic = time.process_time()
mul = np.multiply(x1,x2)
toc = time.process_time()
print ("elementwise multiplication = " + str(mul) + "\n ----- Computation time = " + str(1000*(toc - tic)) + "ms")

### VECTORIZED GENERAL DOT PRODUCT ###
tic = time.process_time()
dot = np.dot(W,x1)
toc = time.process_time()
print ("gdot = " + str(dot) + "\n ----- Computation time = " + str(1000 * (toc - tic)) + "ms")


# As you may have noticed, the vectorized implementation is much cleaner and more efficient. For bigger vectors/matrices, the differences in running time become even bigger. 
# 
# **Note** that `np.dot()` performs a matrix-matrix or matrix-vector multiplication. This is different from `np.multiply()` and the `*` operator (which is equivalent to  `.*` in Matlab/Octave), which performs an element-wise multiplication.
